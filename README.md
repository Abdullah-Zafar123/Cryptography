Overview:
Cryptographer is a lightweight encryption and decryption application built to implement and demonstrate foundational cryptographic techniques. The project focuses on structured cipher logic and secure text transformation within a simple web interface.

Core Functionality:
- Encrypts plain text using implemented cipher logic
- Decrypts cipher text back to original format
- Structured input/output handling
- Minimal and focused interface design

Architecture:
- The backend logic is implemented in Python, handling encryption and decryption processes. The front-end interface is built using HTML and CSS to provide a clean interaction layer.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

Setup:
1) Clone the repository
2) Install required dependencies 
3) Run the Python application
4) Access through your local environment
